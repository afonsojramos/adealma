    "description": "In the historic centre of Caminha, next to the parish church, the union of two buildings gave rise to five flats: two studio flats and three two-bedroom flats. Of the exemplary intervention, one must highlight the perfect distinction of the original façades, composing a classic frontage with the colours of Alto Minho, green and blue. It is also worth mentioning the construction of a lobby, which allowed the creation of an interior garden between flats. Stone and wood are the privileged materials.",
